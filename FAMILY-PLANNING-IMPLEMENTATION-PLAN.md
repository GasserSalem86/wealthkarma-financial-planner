## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Current Savings Priority**: Apply current savings to emergency fund first, then to other goals in priority order
2. **Family Emergency Fund**: Use same calculation (expenses √ó months) but with household expenses and longer buffer recommendations
3. **Retirement Strategies**: Provide clear, jargon-free explanations with real-world examples
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing individual users can continue using the app without changes

### Architecture Considerations
- All new fields are optional with sensible defaults
- Calculations gracefully handle missing or zero values
- State management updates trigger appropriate recalculations
- UI components conditionally display based on planning type

### User Experience Principles
- Progressive disclosure: Show family options only when family planning is selected
- Clear explanations: Avoid financial jargon, use real-world examples
- Immediate feedback: Show impact of current savings and planning type changes
- Flexibility: Allow users to switch between planning types and adjust values

### Technical Standards
- TypeScript interfaces for all new data structures
- Unit tests for all calculation functions
- Integration tests for complete user flows
- Responsive design for all new UI components
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
