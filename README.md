## 🎨 Theme System

WealthKarma features a comprehensive light/dark theme system that provides excellent readability and user experience in both modes.

### Theme Features
- **Automatic System Detection**: Respects your OS theme preference by default
- **Manual Toggle**: Easy-to-use toggle switch in the header and sidebar
- **Persistent Preference**: Remembers your choice across sessions
- **Smooth Transitions**: 300ms easing transitions between themes
- **Accessible**: WCAG compliant contrast ratios in both themes

### Using the Theme System

#### ThemeContext
```typescript
import { useTheme } from './context/ThemeContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { theme, toggleTheme, setTheme } = useTheme();
  
  return (
    <div className="bg-theme-primary text-theme-primary">
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
        Current theme: {theme}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Theme-Aware CSS Classes
The app uses CSS custom properties for consistent theming:

```css
/* Use theme-aware utility classes */
.bg-theme-primary     /* Background: white (light) / slate-900 (dark) */
.bg-theme-secondary   /* Background: slate-50 (light) / slate-800 (dark) */
.text-theme-primary   /* Text: slate-900 (light) / white (dark) */
.text-theme-secondary /* Text: slate-700 (light) / slate-300 (dark) */
.border-theme         /* Border: slate-200 (light) / slate-600 (dark) */
.shadow-theme         /* Shadow: subtle (light) / pronounced (dark) */
```

#### ThemeToggle Component
```typescript
import ThemeToggle from './components/ui/ThemeToggle';

// Basic usage
<ThemeToggle />

// With label
<ThemeToggle showLabel={true} />
```

### Theme Architecture

#### CSS Custom Properties
```css
:root[data-theme="light"] {
  --wk-bg-primary: #ffffff;
  --wk-text-primary: #1e293b;
  /* ... more variables */
}

:root[data-theme="dark"] {
  --wk-bg-primary: #0f172a;
  --wk-text-primary: #f8fafc;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

#### Theme Provider
The `ThemeProvider` wraps the entire app and manages:
- Theme state and persistence
- System preference detection
- CSS custom property updates
- LocalStorage synchronization

## 🎯 Theme Best Practices

1. **Always use theme-aware classes**: Instead of hardcoded colors like `text-white` or `bg-gray-900`, use `text-theme-primary` and `bg-theme-primary`.

2. **Test both themes**: Ensure your components look good in both light and dark modes.

3. **Use CSS custom properties**: For complex styling, use the CSS variables directly:
   ```css
   .custom-component {
     background: var(--wk-bg-primary);
     color: var(--wk-text-primary);
     border: 1px solid var(--wk-border);
   }
   ```

4. **Maintain brand consistency**: The WealthKarma brand colors (green, orange, yellow) remain consistent across themes.
