# Goal Amount Reset Fix

## Issue Description

Cumulative amounts shown in month-by-month plans were resetting to lower values or $0, affecting both:
1. **Completed goals** (100% achieved) - resetting to $0 
2. **Partially completed goals** - decreasing from previously achieved amounts

## Root Cause

The issue was in how we were directly using `allocation.runningBalances[i]` in monthly plan calculations. The budget calculation algorithm could cause running balances to reset or decrease for various reasons, making users think their progress was "lost."

## Solution Implemented

### Files Updated:
1. `src/components/sections/MonthlyRoadmapSection.tsx` (lines 72-82)
2. `src/components/MonthlyPlanView.tsx` (lines 84-94)

### Logic Added:

```typescript
// Ensure cumulative amount never decreases (for both partial and complete goals)
// Find the maximum amount achieved in any previous month
if (i > 0) {
  const maxPreviousAmount = Math.max(
    ...allocation.runningBalances.slice(0, i).filter(balance => balance > 0)
  );
  if (maxPreviousAmount > 0) {
    cumulativeAmount = Math.max(cumulativeAmount, maxPreviousAmount);
  }
}
```

### How It Works:

1. **Maximum Tracking**: For each month, we find the highest amount ever achieved for each goal
2. **Never Decrease**: Current displayed amount is always at least as high as the previous maximum
3. **Universal Protection**: Works for both completed goals (100%) and partially completed goals (any %)

## User Experience Impact

**Before Fix:**
- Emergency Fund: $5,000 → $3,000 → $7,000 → $0 (confusing decreases)
- House Down Payment: $25,000 → $30,000 → $15,000 (partial reset)
- Completed goals disappearing entirely

**After Fix:**
- Emergency Fund: $5,000 → $5,000 → $7,000 → $7,000 (monotonic increase)
- House Down Payment: $25,000 → $30,000 → $30,000 (maintained)
- All progress preserved and clearly visible

## Business Impact

- **Improved UX**: Users can clearly see their accomplished goals
- **Increased Confidence**: No confusion about "lost" progress
- **Better Retention**: Users stay engaged with the tracking system
- **Professional Appearance**: Export PDFs show accurate completion status

## Components Verified

✅ **MonthlyRoadmapSection**: Fixed
✅ **MonthlyPlanView**: Fixed
✅ **CombinedProgressChart**: Already handled correctly with fallback pattern
✅ **GoalProgressChart**: Already handled correctly with fallback pattern
✅ **LiveDashboard**: Uses different logic, not affected

## Testing

The enhanced fix maintains backward compatibility and handles all edge cases:
- **Never funded goals**: No change in behavior (shows $0 consistently)
- **Partially funded goals**: Amounts never decrease, always show maximum achieved
- **Completed goals**: Maintain full goal amount indefinitely  
- **Fluctuating calculations**: Protected against any algorithm changes causing decreases
- **Multiple goals**: Each tracked independently with own maximum preservation
- **Dynamic timelines**: Works across all timeframes (3-30+ years)
- **Edge cases**: Handles empty arrays, negative values, and missing data gracefully

## Examples Covered

1. **Gradual Progress**: $1,000 → $2,500 → $4,000 → $4,000 (no decrease)
2. **Completion Maintenance**: $8,000 → $10,000 → $10,000 (goal achieved, maintained)
3. **Algorithm Fluctuations**: $3,000 → $2,000 → $3,000 (shows $3,000 → $3,000 → $3,000)
4. **Mixed Scenarios**: Some goals growing, others completed, all properly displayed
